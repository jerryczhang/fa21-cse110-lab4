# Javascript Part 1
1. `values added: 20`
2. `final result: 20`
3. `values added: 20`
4. Error: `result` only has block scope, and line 13 tries to get the value of `result` outside of the block it was declared in
5. Error: line 7 tries to change the value of `result`, which is impossible since it was declared as `const`
6. Error: Same reason as in question 5
